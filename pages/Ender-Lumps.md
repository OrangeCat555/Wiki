Ender Lumps are [Magical Items](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Magical-Items) used for crafting other [Magical Items](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Magical-Items), [Magical Armor](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Magical-Armor) and [Magical Gadgets](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Magical-Gadgets).

## Obtaining Ender Lumps
### Tier 1
Tier 1 Ender Lumps can be crafted by placing an Eye of Ender into the [Enhanced Crafting Table](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Enhanced-Crafting-Table).
Each Eye of Ender gives 2 Lumps.

### Tier 2
Tier 2 Ender Lumps can be crafted by placing 4 Tier 1 Ender Lumps into [Enhanced Crafting Table](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Enhanced-Crafting-Table) following the recipe in the slimefun guide.

### Tier 3
Tier 3 Ender Lumps have the same recipe as Tier 2; but instead of using tier 1 Ender Lumps, Tier 2 are used.
