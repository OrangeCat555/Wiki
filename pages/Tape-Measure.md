A tape measure is one of the Slimefun [Items](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Items) which allows you to measure the distance between blocks.

## Obtaining
Tape Measures can be crafted in the [Enhanced Crafting Table](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Enhanced-Crafting-Table).

## Use
If you crouch and right-click a block with this tool in your hand the anchor will be set.
If you right-click another block after setting the anchor the distance between those two blocks will be displayed in chat.
