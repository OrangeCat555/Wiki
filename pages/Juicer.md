The Juicer is a [Basic Machine](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Basic-Machines) in Slimefun.<br>
It is used to turn all sorts of foods into juices.

## How to build a Juicer
The recipe can be found in your Slimefun Guide. To build it, you need to place a Glass on top of a Nether Brick Fence which is above a Dispenser.<br>
A complete Enhanced Crafting Table looks like this:

You can also place an [Output Chest](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Output-Chest) next to the Dispenser to collect your crafted items.

## How to use a Juicer
Place a fruit/vegetable food inside the dispenser and interact with the fence. This will create the juice in the dispenser or output chest.
